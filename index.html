    <p> RABINDRANATH TAGORE</p>
    <p>Rabindranath Tagore was a towering figure in Bengali and Indian literature, renowned as a poet, novelist, philosopher, and composer. Born in 1861, he gained global recognition for his Nobel Prize-winning work, Gitanjali, a collection of lyrical poems.
     Tagore's influence extends beyond literature; he was a social reformer,
     educator (founder of Visva-Bharati University), and a passionate advocate for Indian independence.
     He even renounced his knighthood in protest against British policies.</p>
